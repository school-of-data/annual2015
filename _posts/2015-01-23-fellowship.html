						SCHOOL OF DATA FELLOWSHIP
					</h3>
					<p>
						When we started the Fellowship programme in 2013, it was as a response to this question: how do we ensure sustainable, long-term impact from our trainings, if School of Data trainers are only present on the ground for short periods of time? Answer: a fellowship programme designed to foster long-term engagement, through using the knowledge and contacts their nine-months with School of Data provides to enhance the work of their network for years ahead.
					<p>
						Building on top of the spectacular experience we had last year, with wonderful results, the 2015 School of Data Fellowship was also a staggering success.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our fellows trained more than 1000 people at over 40 training events in 8 countries. Beyond the hands-on training events in various countries, they produced a great amount of CC-BY content, freely available to anyone in the world: 26 blog posts, 8 skillshares, 6 learning modules.
					</p>
					<p>
						We're very proud of our 2015 class and we can't wait to have them mingle with our upcoming 2016 class!

As part of the 19million project in Rome, she created prototype projects in response to the European refugee crisis and developed a project about immigration data in Costa Rica.
