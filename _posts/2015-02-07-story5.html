							In 2015, School of Data started its first research project to gain further insights into data literacy efforts around the world.
						</div><br>
						<p>
							How can we better understand data literacy? How are others developing similar data-literacy activities around the world and how can we collaborate to achieve our shared goals? This past year, we set out to invetigate the data-literacy landscape, looking both inside and outside of our networks.
						</p>
						<p>
							The goal of this research was to empower the School of Data network with strategic information to push the programme forward, but also to obtain valuable findings to share with our peers. Our research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and you can also read more about it over on the School of Data blog.
