							In 2015, School of Data commissioned its first research project, with the aim of surveying data literacy efforts worldwide.
						</div><br>
						<p>
							How can we better understand data literacy? How are others developing similar activities around the world and how can we collaborate to achieve our goals? We set out to invetigate the data literacy landscape, both inside and outside of our network.
						</p>
						<p>
							The value of this research to School of Data was strategic: we need accurate analysis of the data-literacy sphere as it is now, so that we can make informed choices as to how to develop our programme in the future. We also shared our findings with our peers, so that the movement as a whole can benefit from these insights. Our research will be published in a peer-reviewed journal; you can also read more about it on our blog.
