				Our idea is quite simple: what if journalists and civil society organisations understood how to use data effectively in their work? Would we see journalists in a better positon to hold their governments accountable? Would we see civil society organisations empowered to measure and better understand the impact of their activities?
			</p>
			<p>
				Over the past three years, School of Data has evolved from this notion to a flourishing network of individuals and organisations. Together, we have produced dozens of lessons and hands-on tutorials on how to work with data, benefitting thousands of people around the world. We have trained over 5,500 people through our tailored training events and mentored dozens of organisations to become tech-savvy and data-driven.
			</p>

				In 2015, members of the network stepped up to form our first Steering Committee. As well as empowering our community with decision-making powers, we envision this network-oriented governance will ensure the programme remains relevant, keeping its innovative edge regardless of geographical barriers. We also hosted our second Fellowship Class, with seven fellows from all over the world. They were welcomed at our second Summer Camp, in Ottawa, which also brought together our partners and members.

				2015 was also the year that suddenly took our data diva away from us, and we mean to keep making him proud. There would be no School of Data without the passion of our community and the dedication of the amazing team who brought the programme to where it is today. We just can't thank you enough for your support!
