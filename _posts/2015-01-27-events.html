      <h3>EVENTS AROUND THE WORLD</h3>
      <p>Events (both online and offline) form a big part of School of Data; this year, because of the Fellowship scheme, we did a lot more offline events than we have in previous years, reaching many more people! Our current - and ever growing - total of events shows over <strong>90 School of Data events taking place in 30 countries, reaching over 2000 participants </strong>. If you don't see your event showing up on the map below, <a href="mailto:info@schoolofdata.org">get in touch with us!</a>

        <h3>JORDAN</h3>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Senior School of Data fellow Tarek Amr, from Egypt, joined the <a href=”http://ab14.globalvoicesonline.org/english”>Arab Bloggers Meeting</a> in Amman, Jordan, held in January 2014. They collaborated with <a href=”http://tacticaltech.org/”>Tactical Technology Collective</a> to present sessions on Data Collection, Cleaning and Visualisation, and provided more technical workshops on tools and best practices for Data Journalists and Bloggers.</p>

          <h4>Training together</h4>
          <h3>PHILIPPINES</h3>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>We’ve discovered that carrying out training in pairs has lots of benefits - for the participants, a variation in training styles, and for the trainers, the opportunity to learn from your peers and colleagues. So, in June, Sergio from SocialTIC and our very own Anders Pedersen travelled to the Philippines to carry out a data expedition and training for journalists, civil society, and civil servants. More details <a href=”http://schoolofdata.org/2014/06/09/escuela-de-datos-en-filipinas/”>on the blog</a>!</P>

        <h3>TANZANIA</h3>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>In Tanzania, we were joining up lessons learned from various parts of the world when Michael Bauer, Ketty (our Senior School of Data Fellow), and David from Code for South Africa came together to work with the Ministry of Water, and to hold an impromptu data expedition! Check out what they did <a href=”http://schoolofdata.org/2014/06/12/an-expedition-into-tanzanian-waterpoints/”>here.</a></p>

        <h4>Hack the elections</h4>
        <h3>BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA</h3>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Bosnia and Herzegovina has one of the world’s most complex election systems. Never put off by a challenge, our School of Data fellow Codrina and Michael Bauer <a href=”http://schoolofdata.org/2014/08/22/hacking-the-worlds-most-complex-election-system-part-1/”>spent a week wrangling data on the Bosnian electoral systems</a>; and the work they began is still being updated - take a look at the <a href=”https://github.com/zastone/electionsBiH”>Github repo they created!</a></P>

        <h4>Think Tanks</h4>
        <h3>MEXICO</h3>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>Despite our stated target audience being civil society and journalists, we get lots of interest from people who don’t fit into either of these categories. Ruben Moyo, School of Data fellow in Mexico, ran a three-day training for academics and people from think tanks in Mexico City - their enthusiasm for the training was the biggest surprise in Ruben’s fellowship thus far!</p>

        <h4>Pizza Data Meetup</h4>
        <h3>INDONESIA</h3>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>At our data trainings, one of the best results that we could hope for is for participants to be so enthused by the topic that they organise their own meetups. We are so happy to see that this has happened in Bandung, Indonesia, where former workshop participants who had worked with School of Data fellow, Yuandra, have set up a regular meet up, named <a href=”http://schoolofdata.org/2014/12/04/pizzadata/”>Pizza Data Bandung</a>. Participants meet up to talk about data and eat a slice of pizza. A dream combination!</P>

        <h4>Open Data Party</h4>
        <h3>NIGERIA</h3>
        <div class="line"></div>
        <p>So what happens when you have 102 Nigerians representing all the six regions of the country in Abuja, to teach and learn about what they can use data or open data for? <em>It was an action–packed, idea-generating, brain-storming, mind-grooming experience, which will help me in my advocacy as well as in tracking how the budget of my country is being spent, a challenging and yet fun – filled event</em> as described by Clinton Ezeigwe of People to People International. The event was organised and lead by our fellow extraordinaire Olu; read more in his <a href="http://schoolofdata.org/2014/12/08/instigating-the-rise-of-demand-for-data-the-opendata-party-in-abuja/#sthash.DWHEGn6E.dpuf"> blog post </a>. </p>

          <h4>Data journalism</h4>
          <h3>LEBANON</h3>
          <div class="line"></div>
          <p>Three major data journalism events were held in Beirut, Lebanon, this year, in which our Senior Fellow, Ali Rebaie, participated. They included the MDlab academy workshop at the American University of Beirut, working with trainees from across the Arab region; a data-driven journalism day at the Lebanese American University, focused around equipping members of a senior journalism class with missing data skills, including scraping, cleaning and data visualisation best practices; and working closely with a local newsroom, <a href="http://www.almayadeen.net/infographics">Al Mayadeen</a> to help them work more closely with data. We're so happy to see this kind of long-term engagement happening!</P>
