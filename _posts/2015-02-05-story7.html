							Journalists from 12 media organisations in the Philippines participated in the programme organised by School of Data and the Philippine Investigative Journalism Centre, with support from the World Bank.
						</div><br>
						<p>
							The activities were lead by Senior Fellow Sam Leon, who organised a 2-day in person workshop in July, and a series of remote sessions after that, to support teams with their data investigations. The programme was wrapped up in late November, with more than 100 people attending the closing event.

								<strong>“Data Journalism PH 2015 is a workshop every serious journalist should take. More than teaching me practical skills - how to create maps, infographics, and spreadsheets - it made me realize how important it is to use hard facts, as opposed to merely relying on statements, to create a public that is more informed and more critical”</strong><br>
