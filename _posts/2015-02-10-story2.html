							The second edition of our annual Summer Camp not only kickstarted our Global Fellowship Programme, as we welcomed seven new fellows from all around the world, but also brought our community together to discuss the future of School of Data. Between 24th-26th June, in Ottawa, Canada, we discussed our governance, planned our year together and worked with the fellows to design individual programmes for the nine months ahead.

								<strong>10 months later, I am convinced that choice I made when I sent the application form was one of the best decisions Iâ€™ve made for my professional career. I was able to challenge myself and get out of my comfort zone and explore new ways to work with data, learn about it and teach others ways to use it to improve their work.</strong><br>
