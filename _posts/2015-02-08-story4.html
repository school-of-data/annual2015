							Last year we organised, together with the European Center for Journalism, and for the fourth consecutive year, the biggest European Data Journalism event: the School of Data Journalism. The 2015 edition took place in Perugia, Italy, between 15 – 19 of April, as part of the International Journalism Festival. Senior fellows <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/ritazagoni" target="_blank">Rita Zagoni</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/codrinai" target="_blank">Codrina Ilie</a> attended, running sessions and expeditions.
						</p>
						<p>
							The School was an invitation for beginners and experienced journalists to tell stories through data – a field of work of growing importance. A team of about 15 expert panelists and instructors from The New York Times, The Guardian, Twitter, Journalism++, Knight-Mozilla, School of Data and others lead participants in a mix of discussions and hands-on sessions aimed at empowering participants with the skills needed to produce high quality data stories. The topics ranged from revenue models for data-driven newsrooms to sensor data, web scraping and social media data, basic design and visualisation tips and mapping techniques for journalism.
