							School of Data has always recognised the value of open and massive online courses in reaching out to the community. 2015 was the year we furthered this reach by partnering with organisations such as Small Media and the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas in this area.
						</p>
						<p>
							With Small Media, School of Data produced two introductory courses, one on Data Gathering and another on Data Analysis &amp; Cleaning. Quickly our two courses, available in English, Farsi and Arabic, were amongst the most watched at Advocacy Assembly, the open e-learning platform managed by Small Media.
						</p>
						<p>
							Two School of Data Brazil instructors organised and produced the first massive and open Data Journalism course entirely in Portuguese, for the Knight Center for Journalism in the Americas, using School of Data's Data Pipeline methodology. The course was sponsored by the Brazilian Association of Newspapers with support from Google. The project was a staggering success: the course recorded 5000 participants and a plethora of data-driven stories were published using the techniques taught during the course.
						</p>
						<p>
							School of Data is working with both Small Media and the Knight Center to produce more courses in 2016.
